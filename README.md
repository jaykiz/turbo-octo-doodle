Web Development


This is just some practice project that I performed to work on my front end skills.

Further updates will come along as I continue. 

Edit #1: Fixed an error in the footer of each page

Edit #2: Implemented JS page and began creating the request.html

Edit #3: Made some proposed CSS changes to the index.html. Reformatted the footer

Edit #4: Extended CSS to a new file. Finished wiring project together. Changed footer format.
